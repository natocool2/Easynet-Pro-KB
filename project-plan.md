# Easynet Pro Knowledge Base - Project Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the plan for developing the comprehensive Easynet Pro Knowledge Base, which will serve as a resource hub for all aspects of the Easynet Pro Ecosystem. The knowledge base will cover eight key areas, including business intelligence, projects and investment, legal support, marketing and communication, technological development, events and networking, marketplace and market, and education/training.

## Project Objectives

4. Establish clear connections between different components of the ecosystem
5. Provide practical, actionable guidance for entrepreneurs, businesses, and organizations

## Project Structure

The knowledge base will be organized according to the structure outlined in the [00-main-index.md](00-main-index.md) file, with 10 main categories and numerous subcategories:
