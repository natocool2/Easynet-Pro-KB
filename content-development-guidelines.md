## Writing Style Guidelines

### Formatting Consistency

- Use Markdown formatting consistently
- Heading levels should follow hierarchical structure:
  - # for document title (H1)
  - ## for major sections (H2)
  - ### for subsections (H3)
  - #### for topics within subsections (H4)
- Use bold (**text**) for emphasis of key points
- Use italics (*text*) for introduced terms or light emphasis
- Use bullet points for unordered lists
- Use numbered lists for sequential steps or prioritized items
- Use tables for comparative information

### Content Style

- **Paragraphs**: Keep paragraphs focused on a single idea, typically 3-5 sentences
- **Sentences**: Aim for clarity with moderate length (15-25 words on average)
- **Voice**: Use active voice and present tense when possible
- **Perspective**: Use third person (avoid "you" and "we" except in direct guidance)
- **Tone**: Professional but accessible, authoritative but not academic
- **Examples**: Include concrete examples to illustrate abstract concepts
- **Numbers**: Use numerals for all numbers related to data, percentages, or measurements
- **Acronyms**: Define all acronyms at first use

### Language Considerations

- Use internationally understandable English
- Avoid colloquialisms, idioms, or region-specific references
- Define industry-specific terminology
- Use consistent terminology throughout the document
- Prefer plain language over complex words when meaning is equivalent

## AI Optimization Guidelines
